# Multiple Linear Regression from Scratch 🚀

This project demonstrates a complete implementation of **Multiple Linear Regression from scratch** using Python and NumPy — without using libraries like `scikit-learn` for the core algorithm. The objective is to predict **medical insurance charges** based on multiple features such as age, BMI, smoking status, and more.

---

## 📌 Key Highlights

- Built the regression model **from scratch** (no ML libraries for training)
- Implemented:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the cost function
  - Feature normalization
  - Gradient Descent optimization
- Compared results with `scikit-learn` for validation
- Visualized cost convergence and prediction accuracy

---

## 📂 Dataset

Used the **publicly available insurance dataset** from Kaggle, which contains:

- Features: `age`, `sex`, `bmi`, `children`, `smoker`, `region`
- Target: `charges` (insurance cost)
